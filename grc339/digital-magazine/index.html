Indeed, lots of his personal work is done on film but sometimes there is a small budget for it to be included in his commercial work. Brooks talked to us briefly about surf photography, lifestyle work and shooting with film.

                                <p>
                                    The rising popularity of thrifting among more wealthy consumers as an alternative to buying from sustainable and ethical fashion brands reduces the already limited options available to low-income communities when it comes to clothing. Thrifting no longer carries strong taboos of uncleanliness and poverty as it had in the past. So, in the name of eco-consciousness, many demographics that could afford to splurge on high-quality, low-impact purchases are deciding to thrift instead.
