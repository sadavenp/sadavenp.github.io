                            <h2>Surf through the Eyes of Brooks Sterling</h2>
                    
                                <p>Photographer Brooks Sterling is based on southern California and specializes in lifestyle work. Indeed, lots of his personal work is done on film but sometimes there is a small budget for it to be included in his commercial work. Brooks talked to us briefly about surf photography, lifestyle work and shooting with film.</p>

                                <p>According to Sterling started shooting photos because he wasn’t very good at painting or drawing and needed a creative outlet. He picked up my first roll of film from the lab and was instantly hooked. It’s really all he knows…it’s much easier for me to shoot surfing and the lifestyle surrounding surfing because that’s how I spend most of my time. He prefers film to digital for personal work and editorial projects. Digital is the standard for commercial work, but it’s always fun to get a small budget for film when a brand is willing to let him burn through a few rolls during a shoot.

                                <p>From many years of surfing... he can somewhat predict what will happen next. Most of the time he feels he's right, but sometimes he ends up wrong. He notes, "I’m always happy if I can get a least one memorable action photo per session…anything in addition is a plus." Every once in awhile him and his clients discuss a shot and try to create it…but he usually lets them do their thing, while he does his.</p>

                                <p>"I try to always be creating and connecting with new clients, while staying in contact with my existing clients. I currently push my work through my personal website, Instagram, Flickr, and Tumblr. I also work with a lot of different online and print publications." He shoots everyday, but it’s usually personal work. he says that client work is about 1/3 shooting, 1/3 editing, and 1/3 business operations.</p>

                                <p>"I have never really felt like I was in danger…but the Jaws theme song seems to always start playing in my mind if I’m shooting water as the sun is setting…"

                                <p>Brooks Sterling even at a young age is already accomplished enough to make an affordable living off of what he loves to do, surf and shoot film photography. By allowing himself to combine two passions he not only can profit, but hone in on his own admirations when it comes to those two hobbies. Sterling will continue to take film photos and build up his portfolio. He noted that he has plans to travel around the world to photograph local surfers in hopes that one day his work is able to be featured on the big screens or in big prints such as the "The Surfers Journal" or "National Geographic".</p>
